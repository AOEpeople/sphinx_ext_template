# Documentation Template for TYPO3 Extensions with Sphinx

This is an internal template for documentation used by AOE for open source TYPO3 extensions. 

# How to use

While you are inside the extension for which you want to create the documentation, clone this repository in the folder Documentation:

    git clone https://github.com/AOEpeople/sphinx_ext_template.git Documentation

There are some files what you do not need / want, so we will remove them.

    rm -rf -- Documentation/.git/

    rm Documentation/README.md

# License / Usage Conditions

You may use this template for your own extensions under the condition that you remove all references to AOE.
